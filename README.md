# Games Show

Pet-project I've created to try and learn React Native capabilities.

It is a simple app with game search capability and navigation between queried games list and game details.

No iOS version - I'll finish it soon as with React Native it should be quite easy :)

# API

App uses IGDB.com API - [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com). If you would like to run it on your device you must get API key from IGDB and paste it in file named apikey.js.
